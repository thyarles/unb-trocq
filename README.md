Trocq is a modular parametricity plugin for Coq. It can be used to
achieve proof transfer by both translating a user goal into another,
related, variant, and computing a proof that proves the corresponding implication.

The plugin features a hierarchy of structures on relations, whose
instances are computed from registered user-defined proof via
parametricity. This hierarchy ranges from structure-less relations
to an original formulation of type equivalence. The resulting
framework generalizes [raw
parametricity](https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.6336), [univalent
parametricity](https://doi.org/10.1145/3429979) and
[CoqEAL](https://github.com/coq-community/coqeal), and includes them
in a unified framework.

The plugin computes a parametricity translation "à la carte", by
performing a fine-grained analysis of the requires properties for a
given proof of relatedness. In particular, it is able to prove
implications without resorting to full-blown type equivalence,
allowing this way to perform proof transfer without necessarily
pulling in the univalence axiom.

The plugin is implemented in Coq-Elpi and the code of the
parametricity translation is fairly close to a pen-and-paper
sequent-style presentation.

## Building and installation instructions

Trocq is still a prototype. It is not yet packaged in Opam or Nix.

There are however three ways to experiment with it, all documented
in the [INSTALL.md file](INSTALL.md).

## Documentation

See the [tutorial](https://rocq-community.org/trocq/index.html#/quick-start) for concrete use cases.

In short, the plugin provides a tactic:
- `trocq` (without arguments) which attempts to run a translation on
  a given goal, using the information provided by the user with the
  commands described below.
- `trocq with R1 R2 ...` which works similarly to its argumentless counterpart
  except that it also uses translations associated to the relations `R1`,
  `R2`... ; see below regarding how to associated translations to a relation.
- `trocq to A` which attempts to translate the goal to a new goal `A`.
- `trocq to A with R1 R2` is a combination of the two options above

And some commands:
- `Trocq Use t` to use a translation `t` during the subsequent calls
  to the tactic `trocq`.
- `Trocq Register Univalence u` to declare a univalence axiom `u`.
- `Trocq Register Funext fe` to declare a function extensionality
  axiom `fe`.
- `Trocq RelatedWith R t1 t2 ...` to associate `t1`, `t2`, ... to `R`.
  Subsequent calls to `trocq with R` will be able to use the translations `t1`,
  `t2`, ...
- `Trocq Coercion "Off"|"On"` to enable or disable trocq being used as a fallback for Rocq's coercion.
- `Trocq Logging "off"|"info"|"debug"|"trace"` to set the verbosity level.
- `Trocq Usage` to print a small help message describing available trocq commands.
- `Trocq Print Translations` to print a list of all currently registered Trocq translations.
- `Trocq Print Translations G` prints the list of translations registered for a specific Gref `G`.
  it also prints all registered levels for each translation.
